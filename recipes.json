The stuffing is also delicious\nas a side dish with roast pork or as a filling for cabbage rolls.\n\n3 cups canned low-salt chicken broth\n1 1/2 cups wild rice (about 9 ounces), rinsed, drained\n1 cup water\n2 teaspoons fennel seeds\n\n1 pound sweet Italian sausage, casings removed\n3 small fennel bulbs, trimmed, chopped (about 2 1/2 cups)\n2 medium onions, chopped (about 2 cups)\n3/4 cup chopped toasted walnuts (optional)\n\nCombine broth, rice, 1 cup water and fennel seeds in heavy large saucepan\nover medium-high heat. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to medium, cover and\nsimmer until rice is tender, stirring occasionally, about 55 minutes.\nDrain.\n\nSauté sausage in heavy large skillet over medium-high heat until cooked\nthrough, breaking up with back of spoon, about 10 minutes. Using slotted\nspoon, transfer sausage to paper towels and drain. Add chopped fennel\nbulbs and onions to drippings in skillet. Sauté over medium-high heat\nuntil vegetables are golden, about 10 minutes. Add rice and sausage to\nskillet. Sauté until heated through, about 3 minutes. Stir in walnuts, if\ndesired. Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Can be prepared 1 day\nahead. Cover and refrigerate. If serving as side dish, rewarm covered in\n350°F. oven for 20 minutes.) Transfer to bowl and serve. If using as\nstuffing, cool completely and fill bird.\n\nMakes 6 cups\n\n\nRave reviews from the website I stole this from:\n\n&quot;This was easy and delicious! We will have this again as a side dish soon.\nIt seemed like a lot of fennel, but it cooks down nicely and is an\nexcellent addition to the wild rice. I had to talk everyone into trying a\nnew stuffing, but now they can't wait for me to make it again.&quot;\n\n&quot;Yummy and Easy! What a wonderful complement to our turkey cooked on the\nbarbeque. This may become our new traditional stuffing for Thanksgiving.\nOne day later, everyone is already fighting for leftovers!!&quot;",

		"contents" : "I manage to delete my original version of this recipe, but when I searched the net for a cached copy I realized that LOTS of people had similar recipes. Anyway, below is a version that is pretty nearly exactly the same as the one I had written out. I sometimes like to add cooked diced chicken, which I found out during my search is ALSO a very popular variation. And before you read this over and think &quot;this recipe sounds boring&quot; I want to add the disclaimer that you MUST use fresh parmesan and lemon juice plus zest, and that this is best on a hot summer day when a more complicated or heavy dish (like stew) will just make you feel gross.\n\nAlso, do not underestimate the importance of sautéing the garlic in the oil. It brings out the flavour at the same time as taking away some of that raw garlic edginess.\n\nWithout further ado:\n\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 medium-size clove garlic, minced\n1 (8-ounce) package medium-size bowties\n1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice\n1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest\n1/2 bunch basil (about 12 large leaves)\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon freshly grated black pepper\n1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan\n\nBring large pot of salted water to a boil.\nAdd bowties and cook according to package instructions.\n\nStack 5 to 6 basil leaves at a time, roll them up tight and slice across the roll, spacing cuts 1/8-inch apart or less. Repeat with more leaves until quantity reaches firmly packed 1/2 cup. Heat oil in a large skillet over low heat for 1 minute. Add garlic and saute, stirring often, 1 minute. Remove from heat.\n\nAdd well-drained bowties and toss well until coated with garlic-oil mixture. Add lemon juice and zest, basil, salt, and pepper, and toss until basil wilts.\n\nDivide pasta among 4 large heated plates, top each portion with 1 tablespoon grated cheese and serve.",

		"contents" : "NEW YEAR'S CAKE (NEEN GOW)\n\nNeen Gow, New Year's Cake, is the most important cake eaten on New Year's\n- the main ingredient, glutinous rice flour, is a symbol of cohesiveness.\nThe egg-dipped, pan-fried slices have a mellow sweetness and are slightly\nchewy from glutinous rice flour. Mama remembers watching her grandmother's\nservants scraping the slab brown candy, peen tong, for this cake, which is\nthe traditional technique. Brown candy is a kind of sugar that is sold by\nthe slab in 1-pound packages and is also available loose in bins in some\nChinese markets. The slabs are about 5 inches long, 1 1/4 inches wide, and\na scant 1/2 inch thick. The scraping of the sugar is extremely\nlabor-intensive, so some cooks dissolve the slabs of sugar in water, which\nis less authentic but much easier to prepare. Be sure to use glutinous\nrice flour here, not regular rice flour!\n\nSee the introduction to Turnip Cake for how to serve and store this New\nYear's Cake.\n\n3 Chinese dried red dates\n5 slabs brown candy (peen tong), about 11 ounces\n3 teaspoons vegetable oil\n7 cups glutinous rice flour\n1 tablespoon white sesame seeds\n1 large egg\nvegetable oil, for pan-frying\n\nIn a small bowl, soak the red dates in 1/4 cup cold water for 30 minutes,\nor until softened. When softened, remove and discard the pits.\n\nCut each brown candy slab into 8 pieces. Place sugar in a heatproof bowl,\npour 2 cups boiling water over the sugar, and set aside until dissolved\nand completely cooled.\n\nGrease a heatproof 8-inch round, 3- to 4-inch-deep, straight-sided bowl,\nsuch as soufflé dish, with 2 teaspoons vegetable oil.\n\nIn a large bowl, place rice flour. Make a well and stir in cold sugar\nwater. Knead dough in the bowl, adding an additional 1/3 cup cold water\nuntil dough is smooth, slightly moist, and shiny, 5 to 10 minutes.\n\nPlace the dough in the prepared dish and pat until it fills the dish\nevenly.\n\nCut the red dates into halves and place cut-side down in a ring around the\noutside of the dough, leaving a few to decorate the center.\n\nSprinkle the top with sesame seeds. Coat with the remaining 1 teaspoon\noil, using your fingers and lightly pressing down on the dates and sesame\nseeds.\n\nBring water to a boil over high heat in a covered steamer large enough to\nfit the dish without touching the sides of the steamer. Carefully place\nthe dish into the steamer, cover, and steam 35 to 40 minutes on high heat.\nCheck the water level and replenish, if necessary, with boiling water.\n\nThe cake is done when it begins to pull away from the sides of the pan.\nCarefully remove the dish from the steamer and pour off any excess liquid\non the surface. Place on a rack to cool. Loosely cover and set at room\ntemperature in a cool room until the next day, when it will be ready to\neat.\n\nRun a knife along the edge of the cake to loosen sides. Place a cake rack\nover the bowl and invert to unmold. Flip the cake right-side up onto the\ncutting board. Wrap the cake in plastic and refrigerate until ready to\nuse.\n\nWhen ready to eat, cut the cake into quarters. Cut each quarter crosswise,\nnot into wedges, but into two 2-inch-wide strips. Cut each strip crosswise\ninto scant 1/4-inch-thick slices. This is the typical way of slicing a\ncake Chinese style. Beat an egg in a small bowl, until frothy. Dip the\nslices in egg.\n\nHeat a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok or skillet, over medium heat until hot\nbut not smoking. Add just enough vegetable oil to barely coat the wok, add\nthe egg-dipped slices in batches and cook 2 to 3 minutes per side, until\ngolden brown. Serve immediately.\n\nMakes one 8-inch cake, about 72 slices.",

The chicken is now ready to be either roasted in the oven or broiled over an\nelectric or charcoal grill.\n\nTo Roast in the Oven:\nStart heating the oven to 500°- 550°F. Take the chickens out of the marinade. Brush them with\nghee,and place them on an extra-large shallow roasting pan, preferably on a wire rack. Set the\npan in the middle level of the oven, and roast for 25-30 minutes, or until the meat is cooked\nthrough. There is no need to baste while the chicken pieces are roasting, because the enclosed\nenvironment keeps the chickens from drying excessively.\n\nTo Broil Indoors:\nPreheat the broiler. Brush the grill with a little oil to prevent the meat's sticking. Place\nthe chicken pieces, slashed side up, on the grill, and brush the slashed side with ghee.Cook 2\nto 3 inches away from the heat for 20 minutes. Turn and cook the other side for another 10\nminutes, or until the chicken pieces are cooked through. Brush often with gheeduring cooking.\n\nTo Grill Outdoors:\nFire the coal well in advance (about 1 1/2 hours before you are ready to begin cooking), so\nthat a white ash forms over the surface of the coal. This is when the coal is at its hottest.\nPlace the grill at least 5 inches away from the heat, and rub generously with oil.

Continue\nto cook, turning and basting the chicken every 10 minutes, until it is done. The cooking time\nfor broiling and grilling usually varies widely. Much depends upon the intensity of the heat\nand its distance from the chicken. The point to remember is that the chicken pieces have been\nmarinating in a very strong tenderizing solution for two days and therefore will cook much\nfaster than standard broiled or barbecued chicken.\n\nServe the chicken immediately, lightly brushed with ghee or oil and accompanied by Roasted\nOnions.\n\nClassic Indian Cooking\nJulie Sahni\nWilliam Morrow and Company, Inc.",

As much as it's kinda cool to make your own\n&gt; &gt; cheese, I'm not sure it's worth it to me.  Not that it's *that* much work,\n&gt; &gt; just that what I really like is the pureed spinach, not the paneer.  And I\n&gt; &gt; almost have that down how I like it, as of last night.  Tomatoes.  It\n&gt; &gt; needs tomatoes.  And lots of full-fat yogurt.\n\n&gt; Wow. I thought you didn't like yogurt. I mean, I know\n&gt; you'd welcomed tomatoes into your life, but yogurt?\n\nIngredients are different from eating something alone.  I'm still not\nentirely reconciled to fresh tomatoes, but I've used them in recipes for\nyears.  Ketchup, tomato sauce?  Never had a problem with them.\n\nPlus, I've decided that full-fat plain yogurt (just yogurt, mind you, not\nyogurt with cucumbers added, i.e. tzatziki) is a reasonable accompaniment\nto middle eastern and indian food.  I still am not eating a dish of\nyogurt, or those awful fruit-flavoured low-fat yogurt thingys.\n\n&gt; Anyway, do you have the recipe in writing? Can I post it?\n\nHmmm.  It's not exactly specified at this point.  I'll try to get it in\nmore details.  I essentially followed the Joy recipe (so onions, garlic,\ncumin from the cheese frying, and I didn't have dried red hot peppers so I\nput in fresh peppers, halved, but two was too much cuz they left some of\ntheir seeds and membranes in and made it too spicy), except that before\nadding the spinach I put in some tomato (about 1/4 of a large can of diced\ntomatoes in juice.  I was using it for other things.  I don't think that\ncan size exists in Canada... it's a little bigger than the big bean can\nsizes).  Oh, and I didn't bother chopping the spinach.  Then, after the\nJoy is under the impression that the saag is done (how wrong it is) I put\nit in the food processor and pureed it, cuz I know I like my saag pureed.\nThen I started adding yogurt until it tasted right.  Which was lots, like\ntwo or three cups.  Almost as much as there was pureed spinach.  But I\nmaybe added more because, as I said, I made it too spicy and the yogurt\ncooled it a bit.  It'll take me one more time to get it perfect I think,\nand then maybe I'll try to write it up for you.\n\nmoink",

		"contents" : "On my way home a couple days ago, I began to daydream about the delicious ways I could eat some farm fresh arugula I'd bought. Knowing I had extra old cheddar and rye bread in the fridge I imagined the following sandwich would be tasty. I have no idea why I thought that marmalade would be a good idea, but oh man, was it ever.\n\nWhen I was making this, I opened the fridge and took out the first marmalade I saw, which was &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://us.st11.yimg.com/us.st.yimg.com/I/englishteastore_1961_10126730&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Silver Shred.&lt;/a&gt;&quot; It's a lemon marmalade that is mostly jelly. It was perfect. I haven't tried this with other marmalades, but I imagine they would also be good.\n\nIngredients:\nTwo slices rye bread\nFew slices extra old cheddar\nFew leaves of arugula\nHalf teaspoon marmalade\nSUBSTITUTE for marmalade: honey, with lemon juice and rind mixed in\n\n\n1) Top a slice of rye bread with slices of extra old cheddar\n2) Place the two pieces of bread in the oven, or toaster oven, and toast until the cheese melts\n3) Dab (spreading doesn't work) the marmalade over the cheese while it's hot\n4) Top with crisp, cold arugula\n\nBest. Cheese sandwich. Ever.\n\nOkay, maybe not quite as good as the provolone grilled cheese with bacon, arugula, tomato on challah, but a very close second. No, maybe even better than that.",

		"title" : "Menu: Roast Lamb/ Crispy Potatoes/ Chocolate Soup",
		"contents" : "From the TV Show, Take Home Chef\n\nRoasted Rack of Lamb with Parsley, Dijon and Chives Accompanied by Provencal Ratatouille\n\nServes 4\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the ratatouille:\n\n3 tablespoons/45 ml olive oil\n2 large shallots, finely diced\n1 garlic clove, minced\n½ eggplant, finely diced\n2 zucchini, finely diced\n½ small red bell pepper, seeded and finely diced\n½ small yellow bell pepper, seeded and finely diced\n¼ cup/55 ml dry red wine\n1 pound/450 g ripe plum tomatoes (about 6), finely diced\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper\n¼ cup/8 g thinly sliced fresh basil leaves\n\nFor the lamb:\n\nTwo 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-pound/575- to 700-g well-trimmed racks of lamb (each with 8 bones)\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper\n2 tablespoons/15 ml extra virgin olive oil\n½ cup/10 g finely chopped fresh flat leaf parsley\n½ cup/10 g finely chopped fresh chives\n3 tablespoons/45 g Dijon mustard\n\nMethod:\n\nTo prepare the ratatouille:\n\nPlace a medium sized saucepan over a medium heat, then drizzle with the olive oil. Add the shallots and garlic and sauté for 2 minutes or until tender. Add the eggplant, zucchini and bell peppers and cook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the eggplant is tender.\n\nAdd the red wine then the tomatoes and cook for a further 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until the tomatoes are soft and broken down. Season the ratatouille generously to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Stir in the basil and remove from the heat. Cover and keep warm.\n\nMeanwhile, to prepare the lamb:\n\nPreheat the oven to 450°F/230°C. Place a large heavy based frying pan over a high heat. Sprinkle the lamb with salt and freshly ground black pepper.  Drizzle 1 tablespoon/15 ml of extra virgin olive oil into the hot pan and place 1 lamb rack, meat side down in the pan. Sear until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the lamb rack to a heavy baking sheet, meat side up. Repeat with the remaining lamb rack.\n\nRoast the lamb racks for 20 minutes or until a meat thermometer inserted into the center of the lamb registers 130°F for medium to rare. Transfer the lamb to a platter and allow to rest for 10 minutes.\n\nSprinkle the parsley and chives evenly over a plate. Spread the Dijon mustard over the meat side of the lamb racks then press the mustard-coated side of the lamb firmly into the herbs, creating a green herb crust.\n\nTo serve:\n\nDivide the ratatouille among 4 serving plates. Carve the lamb between the bones into individual chops. Place 3 to 4 chops of lamb on each serving plate and drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon/15 ml of extra virgin olive oil and any accumulated juices from the lamb and the pan, and serve.\n\nSpiced Crispy Potatoes\n\nServes 4\n\nIngredients:\n\n½ teaspoon/.5 g ground coriander seeds\n½ teaspoon/.5 g ground cumin seeds\n½ teaspoon/.5 g ground fennel seeds\n½ teaspoon/.5 g dried red pepper flakes\n½ teaspoon/.5 g ground paprika\n½ teaspoon/.5 g ground turmeric\n2 pounds/900 g fingerling potatoes (about 16)\n6 tablespoons/90 ml olive oil\nSalt\n\nMethod:\n\nPlace a medium sized sauté pan over medium to high heat. Add the coriander seeds, cumin seeds and fennel seeds and stir for about 2 minutes or until the seeds are toasted and fragrant.\n\nTransfer the seeds to a spice grinder and cool slightly. Add the red pepper flakes and pulse until the spices are finely ground. Pulse in the paprika and turmeric. Set the spice mixture aside.\n\nPlace a large pot of salted water over high heat and bring to a rapid boil. Add the potatoes and cook for about 15 minutes or until just tender when pierced with a skewer. Remove the potatoes from the water and place them on a work surface to cool for 10 minutes.\n\nUsing a small saucepan or flat-bottomed cup and working with one potato at a time, smash each a potato on the work surface.  Place two large nonstick sauté pans over medium-high heat then drizzle the olive oil over the hot pans.\n\nAdd the potatoes to the hot pans, dividing equally, and sprinkle the spice mixture over the potatoes. Cook for about 5 minutes per side or until the potatoes are crisp and golden brown. Season the potatoes generously with salt. Transfer to plates or a platter and serve immediately.\n\nChocolate and Mint Soup with Melting Chocolate Croutons\n\nServes 6\n\nIngredients:\n\nFor the Melting Chocolate Croutons:\n\nNonstick vegetable oil cooking spray\n1/2 stick (1/4 cup)/55 g unsalted butter\n2 ounces/55 g dark chocolate (70% cocoa solids), chopped\n1 large free-range egg\n1 large free-range egg yolk\n1/4 cup/55 g sugar\n2 tablespoons/20 g all purpose flour, sifted\nPinch of salt\n\nFor the Chocolate and Mint Soup:\n\n2 cups/465 ml whole milk\n1 1/4 cups/295 ml heavy whipping cream\n1/2 bunch fresh mint leaves, coarsely chopped\n10 ounces/275 g semisweet chocolate, chopped\nAdditional heavy whipping cream, for garnish\nWhole small mint leaves, for garnish\n\nMethod:\n\nTo make the melting chocolate croutons:\n\nPreheat the oven to 400°F.  Stir the chocolate and butter in a heavy small saucepan over low heat until smooth. Using an electric mixer, beat the egg, egg yolk and sugar in a large bowl until pale and doubled in volume.  This will take about 3 to 5 minutes.\n\nFold in the melted chocolate mixture. Add the flour and salt and stir with a whisk until smooth. Spoon into the prepared muffin cups, dividing equally.\n\nAt this point, the chocolate croutons can be made 8 hours ahead and refrigerated, then baked just before serving. Bake for 5 minutes, or until slightly puffed and just set around the sides (a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes should come out with batter attached).  Let the croutons rest for 3 to 4 minutes then unmold.\n\nMeanwhile, to prepare the chocolate and mint soup:\n\nCombine the milk, 1 1/4 cups/295 ml of cream, and the coarsely chopped mint in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Remove from the heat then cover and let steep for 5 minutes.\n\nStrain the cream mixture into a large bowl. Add the chocolate and stir with a whisk until the chocolate melts and the mixture is smooth. Pour the hot soup into 6 bowls. Place 3 warm chocolate croutons into each bowl. Reserve the remaining croutons for nibbling. Drizzle with the additional cream then garnish with the whole mint leaves and serve.",

		"contents" : "From: Tiffany Conroy\nTo: Mike &quot;the Mike&quot; Wood\nSubject: ceviche\n\nSend me your recipe! I crave it every now and then. You also mentioned the\n&quot;cooking&quot; times for different types of seafoods. Please include those\nguidelines too please :)\n\nThanks,\n- Tiffany\n\nFrom: Mike &quot;the Mike&quot; Wood\nTo: Tiffany Conroy\nSubject: RE: ceviche\n\nI crave it too.  It's kind of hard to get some of the side-ingredients here though (like tostadas), in the absence of a Mexican grocery like that one in Kensington.\n\nThe best thing to do is go to the St. Lawrence market at just the right time (2-3ish) on a Saturday when the fish sellers are putting together trays of things and selling the whole lot. You'll get something like half a rack of crab legs, a tiny lobster tail and some scallops for one low price.  Awesome.  The scallops I like are the white ones that have roughly the same diameter as a coffee mug.\n\n&quot;Cooking&quot; Times\nI think scallops are the best, but they take much longer than anything else at 5-6 hours. fillets of any whitefish will be done in 1-1.5 hours, shrimp in 2, lobster in 2-3 (although how the hell you'd get it out of the shell without cooking it first I'll never know).  The basic rule is that the fish must lose the transparent look all the way through.  You can test a bit at intervals along the way and sort of watch the chemical reaction take place in cross-section... if you're a science-y food geek.\n\nScallop Ceviche\n\n6 scallops (big ones) diced\nlime juice to cover (~8 big limes)\nrock salt\n2 cloves garlic, chopped\n\n- rinse and dice scallops\n- toss scallop bits together with chopped garlic\n- sprinkle with rock salt\n- pour on lime juice\n- let soak for 5-6 hours, until scallops are &quot;cooked&quot; ie: no longer translucent. drain off lime juice.\n\n1 med onion (or a few tiny ones and some shallots)\n4 roma tomatoes\n1 bunch of cilantro\n1/2 bunch of parsley\n2-3 fresh serrano peppers, chopped small, seeds in if you like it hot\nmore lime juice\ndrizzle of olive oil\n\nchop it all up and mix with &quot;cooked&quot; scallops. add some more lime juice (~50ml) let sit for 20-30 minutes to let flavours mix. (For maximum decadence, you can drizzle equal parts olive oil AND tequila)\n\nserve with tostadas and beer and tequila and white wine.  Also, a beach.\n\n---\n\nA word about tequila; don't buy anything that says &quot;golden tequila&quot; on it. It's low-grade tequila that's been coloured with caramel to artificially age it.  There are three kinds of tequila (&quot;tequila&quot; is like &quot;champagne&quot; in that it is from a particular region)... the three kinds are:\n\nBlanco: clear, basically unaged\nReposado: aged 12-18 months\nAnejo: aged 18+, and it's golden in colour\n\n&quot;Anejo&quot; kind of means &quot;goldish-coloured&quot; which is why Jose Cuervo gets away with calling his stuff &quot;golden&quot;.  But it's bad Blanco with colouring in it.  Don't be fooled!\n\nIn a slushy fruity girly drink-drunk drink, you have to be a real booze-snob to claim being able to tell Blanco from the rest of them.  In a proper margarita (or any other nice drink), Reposado or Anejo is prefered; ditto for giving a bit of essence to food. Reposado of Anejo are both classed as &quot;sipping&quot; tequilas by those in the know (read: booze-snobs).\n\nMike's Proper, Non-Frat-Party Margarita\n3 parts Tequila\n2 parts Cointreau or TripleSec\n1 part fresh lime juice\n1/2 pinch salt\nsplash of GrandMarnier (optional)\nsugar to taste (I use about 2/3 tsp per two tumblers, but some people like it sweeter)\n\nShake with ice and serve on the rocks in a tumbler-style glass.\n\nIncidentally, this drink apparently follows a mixology rule.  The rule is &quot;3:2:1, Liquor:Cordial:Juice&quot; Who knew?\n\nMIKE &quot;airquotes&quot; WOOD",
